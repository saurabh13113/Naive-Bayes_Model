1. Explain what the calculations above might or might not tell you about the "fairness" of your Naive Bayesian network.

These calculations show that the model is quite unfair, and it is strongly biased regarding gender in several ways:

i. It shows extreme disparity in the way it processes evidence sets between genders: 99.96% versus 0%
ii. It also has different high-salary predictions for men, with 66.3%, and for women, 57.3%.
iii. It predicts high salaries much more often for men than women, 25.4% and 8.1%, respectively.
This suggests that the model has learned and is perpetuating systemic gender biases likely arisign from the training data, where gender correlates strongly with other variables.
It fails to prioritize other fair criteria when it comes to salary prediction, such as demographic parity or education and thus cannot be considered a fair model.

 
2. Would you be willing to use your model to recommend starting salaries for employees at a firm? Why or why not? 

No, I would not be willing to use this model to provide recommendations on salaries because it clearly shows some gender discrimination in its predictions, 
and using it would mean a violation of equal pay and anti-discrimination laws. It would also just continue the existing wage gaps through systematic prediction of 
lower salaries for women; and also the model seems to heavily weighh gender rather than focusing on relevant qualifications. In addition, the use of such a model 
in salary decisions might give rise to ethical or legal problems. Significant improvements are supposed to be brought to this model: from addressing issues related 
to gender bias and improvement of criteria that ensure more fairness in recommendations given.
